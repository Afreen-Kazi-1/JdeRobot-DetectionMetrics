## ClassName Files for various datasets:

### Pascal VOC

Text File Listing Pascal VOC classnames in the correct order: [voc.names](voc.names).

### COCO

Text File Listing COCO classnames in the correct order: [coco.names](coco.names).

### Imagenet

There aren't much pre-trained models available on Imagenet for Object Detection, so we've trained our own model specificaly for person class.  
So just create a file with one entry person or just use [this file](imagenet.names).

Faster R-CNN model for the same classNames file: http://jderobot.org/store/deeplearning-networks/TensorFlow/faster-rcnn_Imagenet(ILSVRC2014)_person_only.pb .
