## What is DetectionSuite?

DetectionSuite consists of a set of utilities oriented to simplify developing and testing solutions based on object detection.

# Utilities

## DeepLearningSuite

DeepLearningSuite is a tool designed to experiment upon datasets and networks using various frameworks. Currently it has the following utilities:

+ Auto Evaluator
+ Viewer
+ Converter
+ Detector
+ Evaluator
+ Deployer

Every tool in DeepLearningSuite requires a config file to run, and currently YAML file format is supported. See below on how to create a custom config file.
Each tool may have different requirements for keys in config file, and they can be known by passing the ```--help``` flag.

### Creating a custom ```appConfig.yml```
It is recommended to create and assign a dedicated directory for storing all datasets, weights and config files, for easier access and a cleaner ```appConfig.yml``` file.

For Instance we will be using ```/opt/datasets/``` for demonstration purposes.

Create the following directories in ```/opt/datasets/```: ```cfg```, ```names```, ```weights``` and ```eval```.

Again, these names are temporary and can be changed, but must also be changed in ```appConfig.yml```.

* ```cfg```: This directory will store config files for various networks. For example, *yolo-voc.cfg*.
* ```names```: This directory will contain class names for various datasets. For example, *voc.names*.
* ```weights```: This directory will contain weights for various networks, such as *yolo-voc.weights* for yolo or a frozen inference graph for tensorflow trained networks.
* ```eval```: Evaluations path.

Once done, you can create your own custom appConfig.yml like the one mentioned.

```

datasetPath: /opt/datasets/

evaluationsPath: /opt/datasets/eval

weightsPath: /opt/datasets/weights

netCfgPath: /opt/datasets/cfg

namesPath: /opt/datasets/names

inferencesPath: /opt/datasets

```

Place your weights in weights directory, config files in cfg directory, classname files in names. And you are ready to go ⚡️ .
