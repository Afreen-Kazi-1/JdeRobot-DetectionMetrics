### Using TensorFlow:
TensorFlow can also be used for Object Detection in this tool. All you need is a frozen inference graph and a video to run inferences on.
Some sample pre-trained graphs are available at [TensorFlow Object Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) trained on datasets such as COCO, KITTI and Open Images.

More instructions and tutorials on using the same are mentioned [here](../tutorial/).
